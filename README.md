# cplusplus-fundamentals
Welcome to my C++ repository! All code was written and compiled in vscode, written by me.\
\
I followed [Bro Code's](https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI) and [freeCodeCamp.org's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y&t=12s) video tutorials, and kept my skills in shape through codewars.com. My C++ notes are included in almost every file.

## Introduction

My interest in C++ started with the world of game hacking and cybersecurity. Ever since I was a kid, watching movies that depicted enigmatic hackers was a constant source of fascination. As I matured and learned more about the intricacies of cybersecurity such as the concepts of reverse engineering, memory manipulation, and vulnerability exploitation, the more I wanted to deepen my understanding. I decided to use ethical game hacking as my foundation; however, I quickly realized that in order to truly excel in game hacking, I needed to learn C++, a fundamental language that many popular games use today. This repository captures my journey.

## Final Reflection:

Completing this introduction to C++ marks a significant milestone in my journey in becoming a better programmer. C++ for me was quite literally on a different level in terms of difficulty compared to high-level languages like Python. The transition required me to adapt in my thinking, and the journey wasn't without its moments of frustration and confusion, but each breakthrough made me feel more determined to tackle this language. One of the hardest moments for me was grasping the interplay of pointers, objects, and memory addresses, but it has reminded me that true learning happens outside our comfort zones. With the fundamentals down, I feel confident and ready to embark on more complex projects within game hacking.
